29) Write a C program to reverse the elements of an array.
 

*Input: Read the array size and the array elements.

*Initialize pointers:

  Set a pointer start to the first element (index 0).

  Set a pointer end to the last element (index size - 1).

*Reverse the elements:

  Swap the elements at start and end.

  Increment the start pointer and decrement the end pointer.

  Repeat until the start pointer is greater than or equal to the end pointer.

*Output: Display the reversed array.
